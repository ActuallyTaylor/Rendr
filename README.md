# Rendr
A hopeful artistic Renderer written in Rust.

This renderer is using WGPU and is currently just me following the [WGPU tutorial by Ben Hansen](https://sotrh.github.io/learn-wgpu/beginner/tutorial5-textures/#loading-an-image-from-a-file).

I hope to be able to use the renderer for upcoming art classes that I am taking in college, however it is also just going to be a playground for me to learn Rust slowly.
