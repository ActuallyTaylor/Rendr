# Rendr
An artistic Renderer written in Rust. This is no where close to done and is currently just the end of following the Glium tutorial for setting up rendering. https://glium.github.io/glium/book/README.html

## The Plan
The plan for this Renderer is to advance it to the point I can use it in my upcoming art classes at college.
